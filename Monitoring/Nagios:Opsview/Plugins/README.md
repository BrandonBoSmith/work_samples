# Nagios / Opsview Monitoring Plugins

## Overview
This is a list of varios monitoring plugins I have written over the years.  These examples range from on-prem hardware monitoring to cloud and kubernetes monitoring.

Almost all of this is written in Python as that is my comfy space.

In each case, I performed an exercise of checking to see if there were existing plugins rather than re-invent the wheel.  So all of these examples, were written because of unique use-cases or because there were no existing plugins available at the time.
