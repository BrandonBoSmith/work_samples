## Overview
This script is work-in-progress automation built for the purpose of assisting SRE's when setting up Datadog in a new environment.  It leverages the built-in features of Datadog to identify and discover technology in an environment.  The idea is to let Datadog do the discovery and then output a list of items to make configurations and monitors for.

still a WIP though ...
